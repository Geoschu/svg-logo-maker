# svg-logo-maker

svg-logo-maker is a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG.

- Motivation:

I wanted to create a tool that allows users to generate custom SVG logos directly from the command line.

- Why This Was Built:

To provide a simple and intuitive way for users to create SVG logos without needing to use complex design software.

- What It Solved:

This tool solves the problem of creating simple SVG logos quickly and easily.

- What I Learned:

I learned how to use Node.js to create a command-line application, how to work with SVGs programmatically, and how to validate user input.
